# G-Code Generator #

## Summary ##
This repository contains a class to allow g-code to be generated from Java code. The class contains methods to draw simple shapes in g-code.
I created this class to make by Computer Integrated Manufacturing project easier to make by allowing me to write g-code using java code rather than writing by hand. The code generates g-code for cutting machine wax.
